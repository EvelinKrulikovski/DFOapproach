function [f] = func_4a(x)
%
% Purpose:
%
%    Function func_f is an user provided function which
%    computes the value of the objective function at a
%    point provided by the optimizer.
%
% Input:  
%
%         x (Point given by the optimizer.)
%
% Output: 
%
%         f (Function value at the given point.)
